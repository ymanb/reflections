Initializing a repository creates a .git folder that will be used to track
changes for the files in the folder. It needs to be done so that changes can
be tracked in commits


How is the staging area different from the working area and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where a set of files is gathered together to commit

repository is only committed files. Staging area offers value by offering a
convenient way to group files together that will be part of one commit.
