When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To conveniently work on more than one computer. To collaborate with others.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository.

To have control over what changes are pulled from the remote.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

Fork is to clone someone else's repository on Github to my Github account.
Clone is to copy a repository onto my local computer.
Branch is to create a new chain of commits in a repository.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

You can refer to the last known state of the remote without internet


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

One way is to pass around files using email. Getting and sending files would
be easier because everyone already knows how to use email. However almost
everything else would be harder: keeping things organized, comparing versions,
merging changes...


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly
in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Changes in separate branch can be useful for experiment while master is still
the main baseline. Or when proposing changes to a master that belongs to
someone else. Changes directly in master is simpler.
