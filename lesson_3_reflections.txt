When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To conveniently work on more than one computer. To collaborate with others.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository.

To have control over what changes are pulled from the remote.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

Fork is to clone someone else's repository on Github to my Github account.
Clone is to copy a repository onto my local computer.
Branch is to create a new chain of commits in a repository.
