When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To conveniently work on more than one computer. To collaborate with others.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository.

To have control over what changes are pulled from the remote.
